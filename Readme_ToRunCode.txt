# Readme

Since we are using ipywidgets and IPython.display packages specifically designed for Jupyter Notebook and other Jupyter environments, we request you to use the Jupyter Notebook for executing the code and not the .py file. The Source code has four user-defined functions in the main function. They are 

1. ScrapingToMongoDb()
2. Generate_Form()
3. Filtering()
4. Future_Salary_Filter()

Please run only the functions you are interested in. 
The first function ScrapingToMongoDb()    when run will prompt you to enter a job title you are interested in.
The filtering () function will prompt you to input values into the form. 

The MongoDB database data dump is present in the compressed folder as BSON dump. 

There is an ADDITIONAL FILTERING section towards the end of the notebook to illustrate the functions of the filtering
application.


###### Please run the 4 functions and scroll down to the main function to begin execution.
